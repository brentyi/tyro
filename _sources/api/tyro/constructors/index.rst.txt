:py:mod:`tyro.constructors`
===========================

.. py:module:: tyro.constructors

.. autoapi-nested-parse::

   The :mod:`tyro.constructors` submodule exposes tyro's API for defining
   behavior for different types.

   .. warning::

       This submodule is not needed for the majority of users.



Package Contents
----------------

.. py:data:: MISSING
   :type: Any

   Sentinel value to mark default values as missing. Can be used to mark fields
   passed in via `default=` for `tyro.cli()` as required.

   When used, the 'missing' semantics propagate to children. For example, if we write:

   .. code-block:: python

       def main(inner: Dataclass = tyro.MISSING) -> None:
           ...

       tyro.cli(main)

   then all fields belonging to ``Dataclass`` will be marked as missing, even if a
   default exists in the dataclass definition.

.. py:data:: MISSING_NONPROP
   :type: Any

   Non-propagating version of :data:`tyro.MISSING`.

   When used, the 'missing' semantics do not propagate to children. For example:

   .. code-block:: python

       def main(inner: Dataclass = tyro.constructors.MISSING_NONPROP) -> None:
           ...

       tyro.cli(main)

   is equivalent to:

   .. code-block:: python

       def main(inner: Dataclass) -> None:
           ...

       tyro.cli(main)

   where default values for fields belonging to ``Dataclass`` will be taken from
   the dataclass definition.

.. py:class:: PrimitiveConstructorSpec


   Bases: :py:obj:`Generic`\ [\ :py:obj:`T`\ ]

   Specification for constructing a primitive type from a string.

   There are two ways to use this class:

   First, we can include it in a type signature via :class:`typing.Annotated`.
   This is the simplest for making local modifications to parsing behavior for
   individual fields.

   Alternatively, it can be returned by a rule in a :class:`ConstructorRegistry`.

   .. py:attribute:: nargs
      :type: int | tuple[int, Ellipsis] | Literal[*]

      Number of arguments required to construct an instance. If nargs is "*", then
      the number of arguments is variable. If nargs is a tuple, it represents multiple
      valid fixed argument counts (used for unions with different fixed nargs).

   .. py:attribute:: metavar
      :type: str

      Metavar to display in help messages.

   .. py:attribute:: instance_from_str
      :type: Callable[[list[str]], T]

      Given a list of string arguments, construct an instance of the type. The
      length of the list will match the value of nargs.

   .. py:attribute:: is_instance
      :type: Callable[[Any], bool | Literal[~]]

      Given an object instance, does it match this primitive type? This is
      used for specific help messages when both a union type is present and a
      default is provided.

      Can return "~" to signify that an instance is a "fuzzy" match, and should
      only be used if there are no other matches. This is used for numeric tower
      support.

   .. py:attribute:: str_from_instance
      :type: Callable[[T], list[str]]

      Convert an instance to a list of string arguments that would construct
      the instance. This is used for help messages when a default is provided.

   .. py:attribute:: choices
      :type: tuple[str, Ellipsis] | None

      Finite set of choices for arguments.


.. py:class:: PrimitiveTypeInfo


   Information used to generate constructors for primitive types.

   .. py:attribute:: type
      :type: tyro._typing.TypeForm

      Annotated field type. Forward references, aliases, and type
      variables/parameters will have been resolved and runtime annotations
      (typing.Annotated) will have been stripped.

   .. py:attribute:: type_origin
      :type: tyro._typing.TypeForm | None

      The output of get_origin() on the static type.

   .. py:attribute:: markers
      :type: set[tyro.conf._markers.Marker]

      Set of tyro markers used to configure this field.

   .. py:method:: make(raw_annotation: tyro._typing.TypeForm | Callable, parent_markers: set[tyro.conf._markers.Marker]) -> PrimitiveTypeInfo
      :staticmethod:



.. py:exception:: UnsupportedTypeAnnotationError


   Bases: :py:obj:`Exception`

   Exception raised when an unsupported type annotation is detected.


.. py:class:: ConstructorRegistry


   Registry for rules that define how types are constructed from
   command-line arguments.

   The behavior of CLIs generated by tyro are based on two types of rules.

   *Primitive rules* should be a callable with the signature:

   .. code-block: python

       (type_info: PrimitiveTypeInfo) -> PrimitiveConstructorSpec | UnsupportedTypeAnnotationError | None

   where `None` is returned if the rule doesn't apply, and
   `UnsupportedTypeAnnotationError` is returned if the rule applies but an
   error was encountered. Each primitive rule defines behavior for a type that
   can be instantiated from a single command-line argument.


   *Struct rules* should be a callable with the signature:

   .. code-block: python

       (type_info: StructTypeInfo) -> StructConstructorSpec | None

   where `None` is returned if the rule doesn't apply. Each struct rule
   defines behavior for a type that can be instantiated from multiple
   command-line arguments.


   To activate a registry, pass it directly to :func:`tyro.cli`:

   .. code-block: python

       registry = ConstructorRegistry()
       tyro.cli(..., registry=registry)

   For backward compatibility, you can also use the context manager pattern, though
   the direct parameter approach is recommended:

   .. code-block: python

       registry = ConstructorRegistry()
       with registry:
           tyro.cli(...)


   .. py:method:: primitive_rule(rule: PrimitiveSpecRule) -> PrimitiveSpecRule

      Define a rule for constructing a primitive type from a string. The
      most recently added rule will be applied first.

      Custom primitive rules will take precedence over both default primitive
      rules and struct rules


   .. py:method:: struct_rule(rule: StructSpecRule) -> StructSpecRule

      Define a rule for constructing a primitive type from a string. The
      most recently added rule will be applied first.


   .. py:method:: get_primitive_spec(type_info: tyro.constructors._primitive_spec.PrimitiveTypeInfo, nondefault_only: bool = False) -> tyro.constructors._primitive_spec.PrimitiveConstructorSpec | tyro.constructors._primitive_spec.UnsupportedTypeAnnotationError
      :classmethod:

      Get a constructor specification for a given type.


   .. py:method:: get_struct_spec(type_info: tyro.constructors._struct_spec.StructTypeInfo) -> tyro.constructors._struct_spec.StructConstructorSpec | None
      :classmethod:

      Get a constructor specification for a given type. Returns `None` if
      unsuccessful.


   .. py:method:: __enter__() -> None


   .. py:method:: __exit__(*args: Any) -> None



.. py:class:: StructConstructorSpec


   Specification for a struct type, which is broken down into multiple
   fields.

   Each struct type is instantiated by calling an ``instantiate(**kwargs)``
   function with keyword a set of keyword arguments.

   Unlike :class:`PrimitiveConstructorSpec`, there is only one way to use this class.
   It must be returned by a rule in :class:`ConstructorRegistry`.

   .. py:attribute:: instantiate
      :type: Callable[Ellipsis, Any]

      Function to call to instantiate the struct.

   .. py:attribute:: fields
      :type: tuple[StructFieldSpec, Ellipsis]

      Fields used to construct the callable. Each field is used as a keyword
      argument for the ``instantiate(**kwargs)`` function.


.. py:class:: StructFieldSpec


   Behavior specification for a single field in our callable.

   .. py:attribute:: name
      :type: str

      The name of the field. This will be used as a keyword argument for the
      struct's associated ``instantiate(**kwargs)`` function.

   .. py:attribute:: type
      :type: tyro._typing.TypeForm

      The type of the field. Can be either a primitive or a nested struct type.

   .. py:attribute:: default
      :type: Any

      The default value of the field.

   .. py:attribute:: helptext
      :type: str | None

      Helpjext for the field.

   .. py:attribute:: is_default_overridden
      :type: None

      Deprecated. No longer used.


.. py:class:: StructTypeInfo


   Information used to generate constructors for struct types.

   .. py:attribute:: type
      :type: tyro._typing.TypeForm

      The type of the (potential) struct.

   .. py:attribute:: markers
      :type: tuple[Any, Ellipsis]

      Markers from :mod:`tyro.conf` that are associated with this field.

   .. py:attribute:: default
      :type: Any

      The default value of the struct, or a member of
      :data:`tyro.constructors.MISSING_AND_MISSING_NONPROP` if not present. In a
      function signature, this is ``X`` in ``def main(x=X): ...``. This can be
      useful for populating the default values of the struct.

   .. py:method:: make(f: tyro._typing.TypeForm | Callable, default: Any) -> StructTypeInfo
      :staticmethod:
