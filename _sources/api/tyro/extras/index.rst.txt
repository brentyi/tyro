:py:mod:`tyro.extras`
=====================

.. py:module:: tyro.extras

.. autoapi-nested-parse::

   
   The :mod:`tyro.extras` submodule contains helpers that complement :func:`tyro.cli()`.

   Compared to the core interface, APIs here are more likely to be changed or deprecated.


Package Contents
----------------

.. py:function:: set_accent_color(accent_color: Optional[str]) -> None

   
   Set an accent color to use in help messages. Takes any color supported by ``rich``\ ,
   see ``python -m rich.color``. Experimental.

.. py:function:: get_parser(f: tyro._typing.TypeForm[OutT], *, prog: Optional[str] = None, description: Optional[str] = None, default: Optional[OutT] = None) -> argparse.ArgumentParser
              get_parser(f: Callable[Ellipsis, OutT], *, prog: Optional[str] = None, description: Optional[str] = None, default: Optional[OutT] = None) -> argparse.ArgumentParser

   
   Get the ``argparse.ArgumentParser`` object generated under-the-hood by
   ``tyro.cli()``. Useful for tools like ``sphinx-argparse``\ , ``argcomplete``\ , etc.

   For tab completion, we recommend using ``tyro.cli()``\ 's built-in ``--tyro-print-completion``
   flag.

.. py:function:: subcommand_type_from_defaults(defaults: Mapping[str, T], descriptions: Mapping[str, str] = {}, *, prefix_names: bool = True) -> tyro._typing.TypeForm[T]

   
   Construct a Union type for defining subcommands that choose between defaults.

   .. warning::

       Use of this helper is discouraged. It will likely be deprecated.

       Using the the returned type is understood as an annotation by ``pyright`` and
       ``pylance`` (with ``from __future__ import annotations``), but it relies on
       behavior that isn't defined by the Python language specifications.

       At the cost of verbosity, using :func:`tyro.conf.subcommand()` directly is
       better supported by tools like ``mypy``.

       Alternatively, we can work around this limitation with an ``if TYPE_CHECKING``
       guard:

       .. code-block:: python

           from typing import TYPE_CHECKING

           if TYPE_CHECKING:
               # Static type seen by mypy, language servers, etc.
               SelectableConfig = Config
           else:
               # Runtime type used by tyro.
               SelectableConfig = subcommand_type_from_defaults(...)


   This can most commonly be used to create a "base configuration" pattern:
       https://brentyi.github.io/tyro/examples/10_base_configs/

   For example, when ``defaults`` is set to:

   .. code-block:: python

      {
          "small": Config(...),
          "big": Config(...),
      }

   We return:

   .. code-block:: python

      Union[
          Annotated[
              Config,
              tyro.conf.subcommand("small", default=Config(...))
          ],
          Annotated[
              Config,
              tyro.conf.subcommand("big", default=Config(...))
          ]
      ]

   The resulting type can be used directly in tyro.cli:

   .. code-block:: python

      config = tyro.cli(subcommand_type_from_defaults(default_from_name))
      reveal_type(config)  # Should be correct!

   Or to generate annotations for classes and functions:

   .. code-block:: python

      SelectableConfig = subcommand_type_from_defaults(default_from_name)

      def train(
          config: SelectableConfig,
          checkpoint_path: Optional[pathlib.Path] = None,
      ) -> None:
          ...

      tyro.cli(train)

.. py:function:: literal_type_from_choices(choices: Iterable[T]) -> tyro._typing.TypeForm[T]

   
   Generate a ``typing.Literal[]`` type that constrains values to a set of choices.

   .. warning::

       Use of this helper is discouraged. It will likely be deprecated.

       The the returned type is understood as an annotation by ``pyright`` and
       ``pylance`` (with ``from __future__ import annotations``), but it relies on
       behavior that isn't defined by the Python language specifications.

       At the cost of verbosity, using ``typing.Literal[]`` directly is better supported
       by tools like ``mypy``.

       Alternatively, we can work around this limitation with an ``if TYPE_CHECKING``
       guard:

       .. code-block:: python

           from typing import TYPE_CHECKING

           if TYPE_CHECKING:
               # Static type seen by mypy, language servers, etc.
               Color = str
           else:
               # Runtime type used by tyro.
               Color = literal_type_from_choices(["red", "green", "blue"])

   Using ``Literal[...]`` directly should generally be preferred, but this helper can be
   used in the rare case that choices are generated dynamically. (for example, the keys
   of a dictionary)

.. py:function:: from_yaml(cls: Type[DataclassType], stream: Union[str, IO[str], bytes, IO[bytes]]) -> DataclassType

   
   Re-construct a dataclass instance from a yaml-compatible string, which should be
   generated from ``tyro.extras.to_yaml()``.

   As a secondary feature aimed at enabling the use of :func:`tyro.cli` for general
   configuration use cases, we also introduce functions for human-readable dataclass
   serialization: :func:`tyro.extras.from_yaml` and :func:`tyro.extras.to_yaml` attempt
   to strike a balance between flexibility and robustness — in contrast to naively
   dumping or loading dataclass instances (via pickle, PyYAML, etc), explicit type
   references enable custom tags that are robust against code reorganization and
   refactor, while a PyYAML backend enables serialization of arbitrary Python objects.

   .. warning::
       Serialization functionality is stable but deprecated. It may be removed in a
       future version of :code:`tyro`.

   :param cls: Type to reconstruct.
   :param stream: YAML to read from.

   :returns: Instantiated dataclass.

.. py:function:: to_yaml(instance: Any) -> str

   
   Serialize a dataclass; returns a yaml-compatible string that can be deserialized
   via ``tyro.extras.from_yaml()``.

   As a secondary feature aimed at enabling the use of :func:`tyro.cli` for general
   configuration use cases, we also introduce functions for human-readable dataclass

   .. warning::

   :param instance: Dataclass instance to serialize.

   :returns: YAML string.
