.. py:function:: literal_type_from_choices(choices: Iterable[T]) -> Type[T]

   
   Generate a ``typing.Literal[]`` type that constrains values to a set of choices.

   .. warning::

       Use of this helper is discouraged because it is compatible with ``pyright`` and
       `pylance`, but not with ``mypy``. For ``pyright`` support, you may need to enable
       postponed evaluation of annotations (``from __future__ import annotations``).

       At the cost of verbosity, using `typing.Literal[]` directly is better supported
       by external tools.

       Alternatively, we can work around this limitation with an ``if TYPE_CHECKING``
       guard:

       .. code-block:: python

           from typing import TYPE_CHECKING

           if TYPE_CHECKING:
               Color = str  # For mypy.
           else:
               Color = literal_type_from_choices(["red", "green", "blue"])

   Using ``Literal[...]`` directly should generally be preferred, but this helper can be
   used in the rare case that choices are generated dynamically. (for example, the keys
   of a dictionary)
