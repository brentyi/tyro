# Goals and alternatives

## Design goals

The core functionality of `dcargs` — generating argument parsers from type
annotations — overlaps significantly with features offered by other libraries.
Usage distinctions are the result of two API goals:

- **One uninvasive function.** Whenever possible, learning to use `dcargs`
  should reduce to learning to write (type-annotated) Python. For example, types
  are specified using standard annotations, helptext using docstrings, choices
  using the standard `typing.Literal` type, subparsers with `typing.Union` of
  nested types, and positional arguments with `/`.
  - In contrast, similar libraries have more expansive APIs (sometimes spanning
    dozens of specialized class and functions), and often require
    library-specific structures, decorators, or metadata formats for configuring
    parsing behavior.
- **Strict typing.** Any type that can be annotated and unambiguously parsed
  with an `argparse`-style CLI interface should work out-of-the-box; any public
  API that isn't statically analyzable shouldn't be implemented.
  - In contrast, many similar libraries implement features that depend on
    dynamic argparse-style namespaces, or string-based accessors that can't be
    statically checked.

More concretely, we can also compare specific features. A noncomprehensive set:

[^datargs_literals]: Not supported for mixed types (eg `Literal[5, "five"]`).
[^typer_containers]: `typer` limit itself to positional arguments, which can be more readable in certain cases but means that only one variable-length argument (such as `List[int]`) is supported per argument parser.
[^yahp_docstrings]: Via the `hp.auto()` function, which can parse docstrings from external classes. Usage is different from the more direct parsing that `dcargs`, `tap`, and `simple-parsing`/`pyrallis` support.

Note that most of these other libraries are generally aimed specifically at only
one of _dataclasses_ (`datargs`, `simple-parsing`, `argparse-dataclass`,
`argparse-dataclasses`, `dataclass-cli`, `clout`, `hf_argparser`, `pyrallis`,
`yahp`), _custom structures_ (`tap`), or _functions_ (`typer`) rather than
general typed callables, but offer other features that you might find useful,
such as registration for custom types (`pyrallis`), built-in approaches for
serialization and config files (`tap`, `pyrallis`, `yahp`) and, opportunities
for integration with fields generated using standard argparse definitions
(`simple-parsing`).

## Note on configuration systems

Our API is designed to be used to configure general applications and
computational experiments written in Python, but intentionally tries to avoid
building a full configuration framework (eg `hydra`). These frameworks can
typically be broken into three components with varying levels of integration,
which include syntax and logic for **(1)** defining configurable fields, **(2)**
saving and choosing between a set of base configurations, and **(3)** overriding
configurable values at the command-line.

We take advantage of modern Python features for **(1)** and focus completely on
**(3)** in a way that's agnostic to a project's preferred approach for **(2)**.
**(2)** is left as an exercise to the user; it tends to be the most open-ended
and varied in terms of project and personal preferences, but is typically
straightforward to implement given **(1)**.

In contrast, popular libraries oriented toward configuration often strive to be
more "batteries-included", which is convenient but requires prescribing things
like specific formats, processes, or even directory structures for working with
saved configurations. This requires a lot more moving parts, which can be
limiting if any one of them is insufficient for a particular use case. (or if
you just don't like working with YAML formats)
