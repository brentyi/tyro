# Installation

## Standard

Installation is supported on Python >=3.7 via pip. This is typically all that's
required.

```bash
pip install dcargs
```

## Development

If you're interested in development, the recommended way to install `dcargs` is
via [poetry](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry).

```bash
# Clone repository and install.
git clone git@github.com:brentyi/dcargs.git
cd dcargs
poetry install

# Run tests.
poetry run pytest

# Check types.
poetry run mypy --install-types .
```
