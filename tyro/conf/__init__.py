"""The :mod:`tyro.conf` submodule contains helpers for attaching parsing-specific
configuration metadata to types via [PEP 593](https://peps.python.org/pep-0593/) runtime
annotations.

Configuration flags are applied recursively, and should generally be subscripted:
`Fixed[T]`, `Suppress[T]`, etc.

Features here are supported, but generally unnecessary and should be used sparingly.
